0x02. AirBnB clone - MySQL
In the industry, you will work on an existing codebase 90% of the time. Your first thoughts upon looking at it might include:

“Who did this code?”
“How it works?”
“Where are unittests?”
“Where is this?”
“Why did they do that like this?”
“I don’t understand anything.”
“… I will refactor everything…”
But the worst thing you could possibly do is to redo everything. Please don’t do that! Note: the existing codebase might be perfect, or it might have errors. Don’t always trust the existing codebase!

For this project you will fork this codebase:

update the repository name to AirBnB_clone_v2
update the README.md with your information but don’t delete the initial authors
If you are the owner of this repository, please create a new repository named AirBnB_clone_v2 with the same content of AirBnB_clone

Update the def do_create(self, arg): function of your command interpreter (console.py) to allow for object creation with given parameters:

Command syntax: create <Class name> <param 1> <param 2> <param 3>...
Param syntax: <key name>=<value>
Value syntax:
String: "<value>" => starts with a double quote
any double quote inside the value must be escaped with a backslash \
all underscores _ must be replace by spaces . Example: You want to set the string My little house to the attribute name, your command line must be name="My_little_house"
Float: <unit>.<decimal> => contains a dot .
Integer: <number> => default case
If any parameter doesn’t fit with these requirements or can’t be recognized correctly by your program, it must be skipped
Don’t forget to add tests for this new feature!

Also, this new feature will be tested here only with FileStorage engine.


Write a script that prepares a MySQL server for the project:

A database hbnb_dev_db
A new user hbnb_dev (in localhost)
The password of hbnb_dev should be set to hbnb_dev_pwd
hbnb_dev should have all privileges on the database hbnb_dev_db (and only this database)
hbnb_dev should have SELECT privilege on the database performance_schema (and only this database)
If the database hbnb_dev_db or the user hbnb_dev already exists, your script should not fail

Write a script that prepares a MySQL server for the project:

A database hbnb_test_db
A new user hbnb_test (in localhost)
The password of hbnb_test should be set to hbnb_test_pwd
hbnb_test should have all privileges on the database hbnb_test_db (and only this database)
hbnb_test should have SELECT privilege on the database performance_schema (and only this database)
If the database hbnb_test_db or the user hbnb_test already exists, your script should not fail
